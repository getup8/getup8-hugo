I'm Alex.  Grew up in San Diego and live in New York.

I started this blog in the fall of 2016 because I've had this domain name for
a long time and wanted to do something with it.  I also wanted a place to
document different things I was learning or interested in.  I also just thought
I needed a blog because well, everyone else has one.

*Get Up 8* comes from the ancient proverb:

> Fall seven times, get up eight.

It makes no sense whatsoever but my good friend John told me about it in
college and I've always loved it anyway.
