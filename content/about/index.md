I'm Alex.  Grew up in San Diego and live in New York.

I started this blog in the fall of 2016 because I've had this domain name for
a long time and wanted to do something with it.  I also wanted a place to
document different things I was learning or interested in.  I also just thought
I needed a blog because well, everyone else has one.

## The Blog's Name

*Get Up 8* comes from the ancient proverb:

> Fall seven times, get up eight.

It makes no sense whatsoever but my good friend John told me about it in
college and I've always liked the idea and sound of it anyway.

## Tech Details

This is a static site built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a relatively
simple and very awesome static-site generator.

The theme is a fork of the [Hugo Cactus Theme](https://github.com/getup8/hugo-cactus-theme).

It's hosted, for free, on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
